          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>We're a local Seattle-based friends-owned ice cream shop that began in 2015. We have many award winning frozen deserts that will be sure to win your approval.</p>
          <h2>Ingredients!</h2>
          <p>All our ingredients are organic and from local businesses. We love providing healthy and affordable choices in our delicious, frozen desserts.
            Instead of refined sugars, we use natural sweeteners such as,<a href="http://xylitol.org/">xylitol</a> and <a href="https://draxe.com/agave-nectar/">blue agave nectar</a>.
            We also organize community events that help our neighborhood. Please join our email list for events and updates.</p>
